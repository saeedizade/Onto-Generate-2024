Title: Improving Ontology Generation using Large Language Models

This work improved ontology generation performance using two new prompting techniques. In this repository you can find details of the prompts, dataset for evaluation and some details that could not be fit in the page count : )
## Prompting techniques
The prompting techniques used in this work can be found [here](/PromptingTechniques)


## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available for future ontology generation processes. To prevent LLMs from including this dataset in their training data, it is zipped and locked with a publicly available password.

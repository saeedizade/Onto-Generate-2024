The dataset consists of a set of rows; each row has a competency question (CQ), an ontology story, and an ontology module. CQs and stories have and ID: CQID and StoryID.


| StoryID | CQID | CQ                         | Module  | Category of CQ |
|---------|------|----------------------------|---------|----------------|
| Story1  | CQ1  | Competency question 1 text | CQ1.ttl | Reification    |
| Story1  | CQ2  | Competency question 2 text | CQ2.ttl | Restriction    |


Also, we have ontology modules for each CQ. Each CQ has an ID (CQID), and the module is CQID.tll. Also, each CQ has a Story (StoryID). Modules can be found in zip files here, with the provided password in the repository's main readme. Stories are saved in the second sheet of the paper.
